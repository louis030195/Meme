## Goals

- Easily understandable **interactive** vizualization of memes.
- One scene and concept at a time (don't mix-up black holes with evolution ...).
- Teach and learn.
- Challenge your and others understanding.
- Targetting Web now (maybe mobile later).

## Non-goals

- Super performant code (just enough to have smooth visuals).
- Make money.

## Contribute

1. Create new scene, add it to the build (and to Assets/Scripts/Editor/ProjectBuilder, could be automated).
2. Create a ScriptableObject->Meme which you add to MemeManeger memes list
3. Teach something awesome

## TODO

- [x] Basic project layout, CI ...
- [ ] Better UX (reset camera on swap, should be indicated where to look etc.)
- [ ] Actual vizualizations
